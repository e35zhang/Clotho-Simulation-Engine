Determinism: Thread-safe RNG ensuring bit-perfect replayability of distributed race conditions.

Chaos Engineering: Integrated ChaosMatrix for parallel execution and state space exploration.

Statistical Fuzzing: Input, State, and Scenario fuzzing with boundary value analysis.

Formal Verification: LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) invariant checking and Good-Turing frequency estimation for reliability scoring.

Causality Tracking: DAG-based event tracing for identifying critical paths in distributed transactions.
